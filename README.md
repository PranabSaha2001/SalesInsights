# SalesInsights
A data analysis project on sales insights of a company
This is a project with which includes only SQL and Tableau Desktop. Tableau desktop is a paid version which allowed 14 days trial period. It was preferred over Tableau public because it allows to import files directly from mySQL database. Data Cleaning was performed in tableau itself. 

## Problem Statement
The Sales of a company is going down and the Regional Managers are providing huge excel files with no insights. Since the Sales director has no ground level knowledge hence it becomes difficult for him to manage. 

## End Result 
An automated interactive dashboard providing quick and latest insights in order to support data driven decision making.
